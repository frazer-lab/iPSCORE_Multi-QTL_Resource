# iPSCORE Multi-QTL Resource

![Alt text](ipscore_resource.png)

The iPSCORE collection was generated by the Frazer Lab with the goal of functionally characterizing regulatory variants that are associated with human complex traits and diseases. The collection contains multiple omics datasets from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and derived cardiovascular progenitor cells (CVPC) and pancreatic progenitor cells (PPC). This collection is unique because not only does it contain matched omics dataset from hundreds of samples but it enables molecular characterization of regulatory variation that are active during fetal development, a timepoint that is increasingly gaining interest due to its role in influencing traits and diseases later in life. 

We describe our findings from XXX using the scripts in this repository.
